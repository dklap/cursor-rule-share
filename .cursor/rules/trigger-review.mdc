# Review Trigger

> Full context verification to prevent staleness and maintain accuracy.

---

## `/review` — Full Context Verification

When the user types **`/review`**, systematically walk through all private/ context files to verify accuracy and update timestamps.

### When to Use
- Weekly (standalone or as part of `/weekly`)
- After a break from using the system (>3 days)
- Before high-stakes meetings where context accuracy matters
- When onboarding a new LLM conversation

---

### Review Flow

#### Step 1: Priorities (`private/tracking/priorities.md`)

Walk through each priority one by one:

```
📋 PRIORITY REVIEW

Priority 1: [Name]
- Current status: [Status]
- Target date: [Date]
- Owner: [Owner]
- Last verified: [Date]

Still accurate? 
(y) Yes, unchanged → Update timestamp
(s) Status change → What's the new status?
(d) Done → Archive to archive/projects/
(r) Remove → No longer a priority
(e) Edit → What changed?
```

Repeat for each priority.

#### Step 2: Hot Topics (`private/tracking/hot_topics.md`)

Walk through each active hot topic:

```
🔥 HOT TOPICS REVIEW

Topic: [Name]
- Status: [Status]
- Owner: [Owner]  
- Last verified: [Date]

Still active?
(y) Yes, unchanged → Update timestamp
(r) Resolved → Move to Recently Resolved with resolution note
(e) Escalated → Update status, add escalation details
(u) Update → What changed?
(x) Remove → No longer relevant
```

Repeat for each hot topic.

#### Step 3: People (`private/context/people.md`)

Quick verification (not item-by-item unless changes):

```
👥 PEOPLE REVIEW

Current org structure:
- Direct reports: [List from people.md]
- Manager: [Name] ([1:1 schedule])
- Staff: [Names and schedules]

Any changes?
(y) Yes → Walk through: new hires, departures, role changes, 1:1 time changes
(n) No changes → Update review timestamp
```

If changes, prompt for specifics:
- "Any new team members?"
- "Anyone departed or moved?"
- "Any role/responsibility changes?"
- "Any 1:1 schedule changes?"

#### Step 4: Glossary (`private/context/glossary.md`)

Quick verification:

```
📖 GLOSSARY REVIEW

Current terms: [List from glossary.md]

Any updates?
(a) Add new terms → What terms?
(r) Remove outdated → Which ones?
(n) No changes → Update review timestamp
```

#### Step 5: Profile (`private/context/profile.md`)

Only if major changes expected:

```
👤 PROFILE REVIEW

Name: [Your Name]
Title: [Your Title]
Reports to: [Manager Name]
Location: [Your Location] ([Timezone])

Any changes to role, reporting, or location?
(y) Yes → What changed?
(n) No changes → Skip (profile rarely changes)
```

### Integration with Other Triggers

**`/weekly`** should prompt:
> "Want to run a full `/review` to verify all context, or quick update only?"

**`/first`** after >3 days should prompt:
> "It's been [X] days since your last session. Want to run `/review quick` to verify context is current?"

---

### Staleness Alerts

During review, flag items that haven't been verified recently:

```
⚠️ STALENESS ALERT

These items haven't been verified in 14+ days:
- Priority 2: UAP February Updates (last: 2026-01-28)
- Hot Topic: [Topic] (last: 2026-01-20)

Review these carefully — information may be outdated.
```
