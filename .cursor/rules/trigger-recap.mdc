# Recap Trigger

> Generate post-1:1 summary emails from meeting notes.

---

## `/recap` — Generate 1:1 Summary Email

When the user types **`/recap`** or **`/recap [name]`**, generate a concise post-1:1 summary email based on the meeting notes captured in the daily report.

### Input Formats

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Prompt for name | `/recap` — asks who the 1:1 was with |
| With name | `/recap Joaquin` — generates for that person |
| Most recent | `/recap last` — uses the most recent 1:1 notes |

### Processing Flow

#### Step 1: Identify the 1:1

If name not specified:
```
📧 1:1 RECAP EMAIL

Who was the 1:1 with?
(Match to people.md or specify name)
```

#### Step 2: Gather Meeting Notes

Pull from today's daily report:
1. **1:1 notes section** — Look for "1:1 with [Name]" in Notes & Capture Space
2. **1:1 prep section** — Any items discussed from prep
3. **Follow-up items** — Any new follow-ups created for this person or (Self)

#### Step 3: Extract Components

| Component | Source | Include If |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Key Discussion Points** | Meeting notes | Always — main topics discussed |
| **Their Action Items** | Follow-ups assigned to them | If any exist |
| **My Action Items** | Follow-ups assigned to (Self) related to them | If any exist |
| **Personal Touch** | Personal notes (house, trip, etc.) | If mentioned and appropriate |
| **Wins/Positives** | Positive items from discussion | If any noted |

#### Step 4: Generate Email

```
📧 1:1 RECAP — [Name]

**Subject:** 1:1 Recap — [Date]

- **`/first`**: Note any unsent recaps from previous day

## Template Customization

The recap template can be customized in `shared/templates/recap_email.md`. Default sections:

1. **Greeting** — "Hi [Name],"
2. **Opener** — Thanks + context
3. **Key Points** — Bullet list
4. **Their Actions** — Checkboxes
5. **My Actions** — Checkboxes
6. **Closer** — Personal touch + sign-off

## Privacy Considerations

**Exclude from recaps:**
- Sensitive performance feedback (unless explicitly shared in 1:1)
- Salary/compensation discussions
- Confidential org information
- Personal struggles (unless appropriate to acknowledge)

**Always include:**
- Action items (clear accountability)
- Key decisions made
- Timeline commitments
