## `/standup` — Daily Huddle Prep

When the user types **`/standup`**, generate a quick reference for the daily huddle with direct reports.

### Format
```
## Daily Huddle — [Today's Date]

### [Direct Report Name]
**Hot Items:**
- [Project/Item]: [Last known status] | [Next milestone/date if known]
- [Project/Item]: [Last known status]

**Upcoming:**
- [Date]: [Event/Deadline]

**Questions/Discussion:**
- [Any open items to raise with them]

---
[Repeat for each direct report from people.md]
```

### Behavior
1. Pull latest status from `private/tracking/priorities.md` and `private/tracking/hot_topics.md`
2. Group all items by owner/direct report (from `private/context/people.md`)
3. Highlight any items marked 🔴 At Risk or with approaching deadlines (< 7 days)
4. Include a "Questions/Discussion" section for open threads with each person
5. Keep each person's section to **5 bullets or fewer** — this is a quick reference

### After Generating
Ask: "Any updates to capture before the huddle?"
