# TeamSpace Trigger

> Process TeamSpace check-ins to capture team member updates for 1:1 prep and notes.

## `/teamspace` — Process TeamSpace Check-In

When the user types **`/teamspace`** or **`/teamspace [name]`**, process a pasted TeamSpace check-in and extract relevant information.

### Input Formats

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Trigger then paste | `/teamspace` followed by pasted check-in |
| With name specified | `/teamspace Dustin` then paste |
| Multiple check-ins | `/teamspace all` then paste batch |

### Processing Flow

#### Step 1: Identify Team Member

If name not specified, prompt:
```
📋 TEAMSPACE CHECK-IN

Who is this check-in from?
(Match to people.md or specify new name)
```

If name provided, match against `private/context/people.md`:
- First name match (case-insensitive)
- Flag if unknown: "I don't have [Name] in people.md. Add them?"

#### Step 2: Extract Check-In Components

Parse the TeamSpace format for these sections:

| Section | What to Extract | Maps To |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Enjoyed Last Week** | What they liked working on | 1:1 prep — positive topics, engagement indicators |
| **Ongoing Priorities** | Current work focus | 1:1 prep — priorities table |
| **Asks from Manager** | What they need from you | 1:1 prep — Their Asks of Me |
| **Blockers** (if present) | What's blocking them | 1:1 prep — Blockers & Support Needed |
| **Wins** (if present) | Accomplishments | Consider for /celebrate |

#### Step 3: Present Extracted Data

```
📋 TEAMSPACE CHECK-IN — [Name]
Date: [Today or date from check-in]

(b) Add to daily notes only
(c) Save for next 1:1 (no 1:1 today)
(d) Skip — just reviewing
```

#### Step 4: Apply to Context

**If (a) Add to 1:1 prep:**

## `/teamspace all` — Batch Process Multiple Check-Ins

For processing multiple team members' check-ins at once:

```
📋 BATCH TEAMSPACE PROCESSING

Paste all check-ins below. I'll identify each team member and process individually.

[Paste here]
```

Processing:
1. Split by team member (detect name headers or separators)
2. Match each to people.md
3. Present summary:
   ```
   Found check-ins for:
   ✓ Dustin Janzen — 2 priorities, 1 ask
   ✓ Kelvin Li — 3 priorities, 0 asks
   ✓ Jose Mora — 1 priority, 2 asks
   ⚠️ Unknown: "Sam" — Who is this?
   
   Process all? (y/n)
   ```
4. Apply to respective 1:1 preps or daily notes

## Privacy Note

TeamSpace check-ins may contain personal sentiments (enjoyed/frustrated). Handle with appropriate discretion:
- Don't share "enjoyed" items publicly without permission
- Treat as input for 1:1 conversations, not public status
