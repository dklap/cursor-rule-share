## `/first` — Morning Kickoff & Daily Report

When the user types **`/first`**, generate today's daily report file and archive the previous day's report.

### What It Does
1. **Archives yesterday's report** → Moves `Daily_Report_[Yesterday].md` to `archive/daily_reports/`
2. **Creates today's report** → `active/Daily_Report_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. **Pulls context** from `private/tracking/priorities.md`, `private/tracking/hot_topics.md`, and `private/context/people.md`

### Daily Report Template
```markdown
# Daily Report — [Day of Week], [Month DD, YYYY]

## 🎯 Today's Top 3
1. [Priority 1 — pulled from priorities.md]
2. [Priority 2]
3. [Priority 3]

## 📅 Today's Calendar Highlights
| Time | Meeting | Prep Notes |
|------|---------|------------|
| [Time] | [Meeting Name] | [Quick context or link to prep] |

## 🤝 1:1 Prep (Auto-Generated)
[If 1:1 scheduled for today based on people.md cadence, include prep section]

## 🔥 Hot Topics Snapshot
[Pulled from hot_topics.md — quick status reminder]

## 🚨 Blocked Items (Jira)
[Query Jira for blocked items across team projects]

| Team | Project | Issue | Summary | Assignee |
|------|---------|-------|---------|----------|
| [Team Name] | [Project Key] | [Issue Link] | [Summary] | [Assignee Name] |

*Query: status=Blocked OR labels=BLOCKED in [YOUR_JIRA_PROJECTS from glossary.md]*

## 📋 Open Follow-Up Items
[Pull from previous day's captured /followup tags and any unresolved follow-ups]
[**Sort by Person alphabetically**, with (Self) items at the end]

| Person | Topic | Date Added | Status |
|--------|-------|------------|--------|
| [Name] | [Follow-up topic] | [Date] | ⏳ Open |

*Carried forward until marked complete or moved to a project/priority*

## ⏰ Upcoming This Week
| Date | Event | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| [Date] | [Event] | [Context] |

## 📝 Notes & Capture Space
[Space for ad-hoc notes during the day]

---

### 🔑 Quick Capture Key
| Tag | Use For | Example |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `/decision[topic]:` | Decisions made | `/decision[arch]: Using LangGraph for new agents` |
| `/escalate:` | Issues to raise | `/escalate: MCP perf blocking timeline` |
| `/delegate:` | Tasks to assign | `/delegate: [Name] - review metrics` |
| `/win:` | Wins to celebrate | `/win: BETA exit criteria 3/4 complete` |
| `/hot:` | New hot topic | `/hot: Vendor contract renewal due Feb` |
| `/person:` | New contact | `/person: [Name] (PM on project) - met at LT` |
| `/followup:` | Action items | `/followup: Check with [Name] on status` |

*`/close` will process these and queue confirmations for tomorrow's `/first`*

---
*Generated: [Timestamp] | Archive: archive/daily_reports/*
```

### Behavior
1. On `/first`, check if yesterday's report exists → archive it
2. **Check for pending confirmations** from yesterday's `/close`:
   - If `active/pending_confirmations.md` exists, present items for quick Y/N confirmation
   - Apply confirmed items to relevant private/ files
   - Delete or archive the pending file
3. **Query Jira for blocked items** across team projects:
   - Projects: [Configure in glossary.md or people.md - list your team's Jira project keys]
   - JQL: `project in ([PROJECT_KEYS]) AND (status = Blocked OR labels = BLOCKED) AND status not in (Done, Cancelled)`
   - Display blocked items grouped by team for quick triage
4. **Filter calendar for meetings only**:
   - Ignore standing reminders (e.g., "Gratitudes Due", "Friday Gratitudes")
   - Only include actual meetings with attendees or Webex links
5. Create today's report file with template
6. Pull data from private/ files
7. If 1:1 detected for today, run that prep inline
8. Prompt: "Good morning! Here's your daily report. Anything you want to add to today's focus?"

### 1:1 Prep: Name Matching Rules

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Do NOT hallucinate or merge names**

When matching a calendar invite name (e.g., "1:1 [Your Name]/[Other Name]") to a person in `people.md`:

1. **Only use FIRST NAME for matching** unless the calendar invite includes a full name
2. **If multiple people share a first name**, ASK the user which one before generating prep
3. **NEVER combine parts of different people's names** (e.g., don't hallucinate full names)
4. **If person is not in people.md**, mark as "New 1:1" and ask user for context rather than guessing
5. **Check the manager chain**: If you know someone's manager, use that as a hint

Example of WRONG behavior:
- Calendar shows: "1:1 with [Name]"
- people.md has: "[Different Full Name]"
- ❌ WRONG: Assume a combined/hallucinated name
- ✅ RIGHT: Ask "I see a 1:1 with [Name] but don't have them in people.md. Can you confirm who this is?"

### Quick Mode
`/first quiet` — Generate report without prompting for additions

---

## `/close` — End-of-Session Context Refresh

When the user types **`/close`**, initiate a structured check-in to capture updates for context files.

### Step 0: Scan Today's Conversation

Before checking the daily report, scan the **entire conversation history** from this session:

1. **Identify potentially missed context**:
   - New acronyms or terms explained → Should go to `glossary.md`?
   - Program/project status updates discussed → Should update `priorities.md`?
   - New people or stakeholders mentioned → Should add to `people.md`?
   - Decisions made or recommendations given → Should log?
   - New concerns or risks raised → Should add to `hot_topics.md`?
   - Links to documents shared → Should capture reference?

2. **Cross-check against existing context files**:
   - Is this acronym already in glossary? If not, flag it.
   - Was this status update already captured? If not, flag it.
   - Is this person already in people.md? If not, flag it.

3. **Present conversation findings**:
   ```
   📡 Scanning today's conversation...
   
   I found these items that may not be captured yet:
   
   📖 Glossary (new terms):
   - [Term]: [Definition from conversation]
   
   🎯 Priority Updates:
   - [Priority]: [Status/info discussed]
   
   👥 People:
   - [Name]: [Role/context mentioned]
   
   🔥 Hot Topics:
   - [Topic]: [Context from conversation]
   
   📎 Documents Referenced:
   - [Doc name]: [URL shared]
   
   Should I add these to your context files? (y/n for each, or 'all')
   ```

### Step 1: Process Daily Report Notes (MANDATORY)

**⚠️ DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP** — The Notes & Capture Space often contains critical follow-ups, decisions, and context.

Read today's `active/Daily_Report_YYYY-MM-DD.md` and thoroughly scan the **Notes & Capture Space** section:

1. **Extract ALL captured notes** from the day — read the entire section
2. **Look for tagged items**:
   - `/followup` — Add to Open Follow-Up Items
   - `/delegate` — Add to Open Follow-Up Items (marked as delegate)
   - `/decision` — Log to appropriate Decision_Log
   - `/hot` — Add to hot_topics.md
   - `/person` — Add to people.md
   - `/win` — Log to Wins_Log.md
3. **Infer untagged updates**:
   - New people/stakeholders mentioned by name → Add to people.md?
   - Meeting notes with action items → Follow-ups?
   - Status updates discussed → Priority changes?
   - New terms/acronyms explained → Glossary?
   - URLs/documents shared → Capture reference?
   - Organizational changes mentioned → Update people.md?
4. **Merge with conversation findings** from Step 0 (deduplicate)
5. **Present ALL findings for confirmation**:
   ```
   📝 From your daily notes + conversation:
   
   📋 Follow-ups found: [count]
   | Person | Topic |
   |--------|-------|
   | ... | ... |
   
   👥 New People: [count]
   | Name | Role/Context |
   |------|--------------|
   | ... | ... |
   
   🔥 Hot Topics: [count]
   📖 Glossary Terms: [count]
   📌 Delegates: [count]
   
   Add all? (y/n for each category, or 'all')
   ```
6. **Queue confirmed items** for `/first` verification tomorrow

### Step 2: Priority Status Check
For each priority in `private/tracking/priorities.md`:
1. "**[Priority Name]** — Any status change? (Still 🟡 In Progress, moved to 🟢 Complete, or 🔴 At Risk?)"
2. "Any updates to target dates or milestones?"
3. "New blockers, dependencies, or risks to note?"

### Step 3: Hot Topics Refresh
4. "Any new hot topics or escalations that came up today?"
5. "Any hot topics that can be retired or marked resolved?"

### Step 4: People & Org Updates
6. "Any changes to team structure, new hires, departures, or role changes?"
7. "Any new stakeholders or relationships worth noting?"

### Step 5: Upcoming Events
8. "Any important meetings, deadlines, or events coming up I should add?"

### Step 6: Learnings & Context
9. "Anything you explained multiple times today that should be added to context?"
10. "Any new acronyms, terms, or domain knowledge worth capturing?"

### Wrap-Up
- Summarize proposed changes
- Offer to apply updates to the relevant private/ files
- Update timestamps
- **Save pending confirmations** to `active/pending_confirmations.md` for `/first` review

### Pending Confirmations File

If any inferred items need morning verification, create/update:
```markdown
# Pending Confirmations — [Date]

Items inferred from yesterday's notes, awaiting confirmation:

## Hot Topics
- [ ] [Inferred topic] — Source: "[note excerpt]"

## Priority Updates  
- [ ] [Priority] → [Status change]

## People
- [ ] [Name] — [Role/context]

## Decisions
- [ ] [Decision] — Log to Decision_Log_[Topic].md?

---
*Review these at /first tomorrow*
```

---

## `/weekly` — Weekly Review & Planning

When the user types **`/weekly`**, initiate a structured weekly review.

### Format
```
## Weekly Review — Week of [Date]

### 📝 Draft Update for Leadership (optional)
> [2-3 bullet summary suitable for upward communication]
```

### Conversation Flow
1. "Want to run a full `/review` to verify all context, or quick status update only?"
2. "Let's review your priorities — any status changes this week?"
3. "Any hot topics resolved or new ones to add?"
4. "Quick retro: One win and one challenge from this week?"
5. "What's the most important thing for next week?"
6. "Is your manager 1:1 this week or next?" (if bi-weekly)
7. "Want me to draft a summary for leadership?"

### After Review
- Offer to update `private/tracking/priorities.md` and `private/tracking/hot_topics.md`
- Archive any completed priorities to `archive/projects/`

---

## `/review-prep` — Direct Report Performance Review Context

When the user types **`/review-prep [name]`**, load that direct report's confidential performance file for review preparation.

### What It Does
1. **Loads DR file** from `private/confidential/reviews/[name].md`
2. **Displays key context** for review prep:
   - Current goals & status
   - Strengths and development areas
   - Recent feedback captured
   - Previous review summaries
3. **Enables private drafting** of review content within that session

### Usage Examples
- `/review-prep [direct_report_name]` — Load that DR's performance context

### Name Matching
Use first name match against files in `private/confidential/reviews/`:
- `[firstname_lastname].md` → [Firstname]

The system will match first names to files in the reviews folder.

### Output Format
```markdown
## 🔒 Review Prep: [Name]

**Role**: [Current role from file]
**Goals Status**: [Quick summary]

### Key Strengths
- [Bullet list from file]

### Development Focus
- [Bullet list from file]

### Recent Feedback
| Date | Source | Summary |
|------|--------|---------|
| ... | ... | ... |

### Previous Review Summary
[Last review notes if available]

---
*Ready to draft review content. What section are you working on?*
```

---

## 🔒 Confidential Content Isolation Rules

**These files are NEVER to be included in any output except via explicit `/review-prep` trigger:**

### Protected Folders
- `private/confidential/reviews/` — Performance data for each direct report
- `private/confidential/` — All files in this folder (org structure analysis, sensitive planning)

### Isolation Behavior
When generating ANY of the following, **exclude all content from `private/confidential/`**:

1. **Email drafts** — Never include DR performance data or org structure thinking
2. **Slack messages** — Never include DR performance data or org analysis
3. **/close summaries** — Never mention DR performance observations or org planning
4. **/first daily reports** — Never include DR feedback, review content, or org restructuring thoughts
5. **/weekly summaries** — Never include individual performance details or staff evaluations
6. **Standup or status updates** — Never include review content or org analysis
7. **Meeting prep** (except /review-prep) — Never include performance data
8. **Any communication to others** — This is private manager context only

### Allowed Access
- `/review-prep [name]` — Explicitly loads that DR's file
- Direct questions like "What are [DR Name]'s development goals?" — Answer from context but mark as confidential
- 1:1 prep when explicitly preparing for a DR conversation
- Org structure discussions when the user explicitly asks to continue the analysis

### Why This Matters
Performance feedback, compensation notes, development observations, and org structure thinking are sensitive. They should inform the user's thinking but never appear in outbound communications.
