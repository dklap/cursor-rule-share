## Welcome Message

```
👋 Welcome to MyVoice — your personal LLM context management system!

I'll help you set up your private context files. This takes about 15-20 minutes
and will make all future conversations much more relevant to your work.

The files we create will be stored locally in private/ and never pushed to git.
The shared/ folder contains templates and triggers you can share with others.

Ready to start?
```

---

## Setup Flow

### Step 1: Create Profile (`private/context/profile.md`)

**Prompt:**
```
Let's start with your basic profile.

1. What's your name?
2. What's your job title?
3. What company/organization do you work for?
4. What department or team are you in?
5. Who do you report to? (Name and title)
6. What's your location and time zone?
7. Do you have an admin assistant? (Name, if yes)
```

**Template to populate:**
```markdown
# Profile

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | [Response 1] |
| **Title** | [Response 2] |
| **Organization** | [Response 3] |
| **Department** | [Response 4] |
| **Reports To** | [Response 5] |
| **Location** | [Response 6] |
| **Time Zone** | [Inferred from location] |

## Admin Support

| Name | Role | Contact |
|------|------|---------|
| [Response 7 or "N/A"] | Admin Assistant | [If applicable] |

## Technical Context

### Domain Expertise
[Ask follow-up: "What technical domains should I assume you're familiar with?"]

## Quick Reference Links

| Resource | Link | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| [Ask for key internal resources] | | |
```

---

### Step 2: Create People (`private/context/people.md`)

**Prompt:**
```
Now let's map out the people you work with regularly.

DIRECT REPORTS:
1. Do you have direct reports? If yes, for each one:
   - Name and title
   - What do they own/focus on?
   - When is your 1:1 with them? (Day/time)

MANAGER:
2. Tell me about your 1:1 cadence with [their manager from profile]:
   - Fixed day/time, or variable?

KEY PARTNERS:
3. Who are 2-3 people outside your team you work with regularly?
   - Name, role, and what you collaborate on

PEERS:
4. Who are your peer leaders? (Same level, different teams)
```

**Build the file iteratively based on responses.**

---

### Step 3: Create Priorities (`private/tracking/priorities.md`)

**Prompt:**
```
What are you focused on right now?

1. What are your top 2-3 work priorities?
   For each one:
   - Name/title of the initiative
   - Current status (on track, at risk, blocked?)
   - Target date or deadline
   - Who owns it / who are key stakeholders?
   - Any key milestones or exit criteria?

2. Are there any "hot topics" — things requiring immediate attention or 
   that keep coming up in leadership discussions?
```

**Create both `priorities.md` and `hot_topics.md` from responses.**

---

### Step 4: Create Glossary (`private/context/glossary.md`)

**Prompt:**
```
Every organization has its own language. Let's capture yours.

1. What acronyms or abbreviations do you use daily that an outsider 
   wouldn't know? (e.g., internal project names, team abbreviations)

2. Any internal tools, systems, or platforms with specific names?

3. Any organizational terms I should know? (Leadership team names, 
   meeting names, etc.)
```

---

### Step 5: Verify .gitignore

**Action:**
Check that `.gitignore` exists and contains:
```
private/
active/
archive/
```

If not, create or update it.

---

### Step 6: Create Full Folder Structure

**Action:**
Ensure these directories exist:

```
private/
├── context/
├── tracking/
├── projects/
├── confidential/
│   └── reviews/
└── Documents/

active/
├── communications/
├── decisions/
└── wins/

archive/
├── daily_reports/
├── communications/
├── decisions/
├── projects/
└── wins/
```

---

### Step 7: Configure MCP Integrations (Optional)

**What is MCP?**
Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows VS Code Copilot to connect directly to external tools like Jira, Confluence, and other systems. This enables seamless searching, creating, and updating of issues/pages without leaving your editor.

**Prompt:**
```
Do you use Jira or Confluence? If so, I can help you set up the Atlassian MCP 
integration for direct access from Copilot.

This enables:
- Searching Jira issues with natural language (Rovo Search)
- Creating and updating Jira issues
- Reading and editing Confluence pages
- All without leaving VS Code
```

**If yes, guide through setup:**

#### Atlassian (Jira/Confluence) MCP Setup

1. **Install the Atlassian MCP Server**
   - Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl+, or Cmd+,)
   - Search for "MCP" or navigate to **Extensions > GitHub Copilot > MCP**
   - Or directly edit your `settings.json`:

   ```json
   "mcp": {
     "servers": {
       "atlassian": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/atlassian-mcp-server"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Authenticate with Atlassian**
   - The first time you use an Atlassian MCP tool, you'll be prompted to authenticate
   - Follow the OAuth flow to connect your Atlassian account
   - Grant access to the Jira/Confluence sites you need

3. **Verify Connection**
   - Ask Copilot: "Search for my recent Jira issues"
   - If successful, you'll see results from your Jira instance

4. **Add Jira Project Keys to Glossary**
   After setup, update your `private/context/glossary.md` with your Jira project keys:
   ```markdown
   ## Jira Projects
   | Key | Name | Description |
   |-----|------|-------------|
   | PROJ | Project Name | Main development project |
   | TEAM | Team Board | Team sprint board |
   ```

**Available MCP Tools (once configured):**
| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `search` | Natural language search across Jira + Confluence (Rovo) |
| `getJiraIssue` | Get details of a specific issue by key |
| `createJiraIssue` | Create new issues with description |
| `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` | Advanced search with JQL |
| `getConfluencePage` | Read Confluence page content |
| `createConfluencePage` | Create new Confluence pages |

**Troubleshooting:**
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "No accessible resources" | Re-authenticate; check you have access to the Atlassian site |
| "Cloud ID not found" | Use `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` to find your Cloud ID |
| "Permission denied" | Ensure your Atlassian account has appropriate permissions |

## Completion Message

```
✅ Setup complete! Your MyVoice context system is ready.

FILES CREATED:
├── private/context/
│   ├── profile.md      — Your identity and role
│   ├── people.md       — Org structure and 1:1 schedules
│   └── glossary.md     — Domain terminology
├── private/tracking/
│   ├── priorities.md   — Current work priorities
│   └── hot_topics.md   — Active concerns
├── private/projects/   — For time-bounded initiatives
├── private/confidential/reviews/  — For performance reviews
└── private/Documents/  — For reference documents

FOLDERS READY:
├── active/             — Today's work (daily reports, drafts)
└── archive/            — Historical records

WHAT'S NEXT:
1. Use /first each morning to generate your daily report
2. Use /close at end of sessions to keep context fresh
3. Use /prep 1:1 [name] before meetings
4. Use /decision, /followup, /delegate during the day

All your personal data stays in private/ — only the shared/ templates 
can be pushed to git.

Want to try /first now to generate today's daily report?
```

---

## Quick Setup (Experienced Users)

For users who want to set up quickly:

```
/setup quick

I'll create template files for you to fill in manually:
- private/context/profile.md
- private/context/people.md
- private/tracking/priorities.md
- private/tracking/hot_topics.md
- private/context/glossary.md

Each file has placeholder sections. Fill them in at your own pace,
then use /first to test your setup.
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "private/ folder doesn't exist" | Create it: `mkdir private` |
| "Files not being ignored by git" | Check .gitignore has `private/` line |
| "Triggers not working" | Ensure shared/triggers/ files are present |
| "Missing initialization prompt" | Check shared/initialization_prompt.md exists |

---

## Migration from Single-File Setup

If user has an existing `LLM_Context_Profile.md`:

```
I see you have an existing LLM_Context_Profile.md file.

Would you like me to:
(a) Migrate — Extract your data into the new modular structure
(b) Archive — Move it to archive/projects/ and start fresh
(c) Keep both — Leave the old file and create new structure alongside

Recommendation: (a) Migrate — I'll preserve all your existing context.
```
