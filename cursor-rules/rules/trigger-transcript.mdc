## `/transcript` — Process Meeting Notes

When the user types **`/transcript`** or pastes a meeting transcript, analyze and extract actionable information.

### Input Formats

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Trigger then paste | `/transcript` followed by pasted text |
| Inline with context | `/transcript 1:1 with Lisa` then paste |
| File reference | `/transcript file:meeting_notes.txt` |
| Quick mode | `/transcript quick` — extract action items only |

### Processing Flow

#### Step 1: Identify Meeting Context

Prompt (if not provided):
```
📝 TRANSCRIPT PROCESSING

What type of meeting was this?
(a) 1:1 — with direct report, manager, or partner
(b) Team — standup, huddle, team meeting
(c) Leadership — LT, cross-functional leadership
(d) External — vendor, customer, partner
(e) Other — specify

Who was in the meeting? (I'll match to people.md)
```

#### Step 2: Name Recognition

Cross-reference all names mentioned against `private/context/people.md`:

| Found Name | Match Status | Action |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| [Name] | ✅ Known (Direct Report) | Link to profile |
| [Name] | ✅ Known (Partner) | Link to profile |
| [Name] | ❓ Unknown | Flag for people.md addition |

For unknown names, prompt:
```
I found these names not in your people.md:
- [Name 1] — Who is this? (role/context)
- [Name 2] — Who is this?

Add to people.md? (y/n for each)
```

#### Step 3: Extract Action Items

Scan for patterns indicating follow-ups:

| Pattern | Example | Extraction |
|---------|---------|------------|
| "I'll..." / "I will..." | "I'll send that doc" | → (Self) follow-up |
| "[Name] will..." | "Lisa will update the widget" | → Follow-up for [Name] |
| "Can you..." / "Could you..." | "Can you check on that?" | → Follow-up for speaker's target |
| "Action item:" | "Action item: review metrics" | → Explicit follow-up |
| "Let's..." / "We should..." | "Let's circle back on this" | → (Self) follow-up |
| "By [date]..." | "By Friday, we need..." | → Follow-up with deadline |
| "Follow up on..." | "Follow up on the ticket" | → Explicit follow-up |

Output format:
```
📋 ACTION ITEMS FOUND: [count]

| Person | Action | Source Quote | Deadline |
|--------|--------|--------------|----------|
| (Self) | Send doc to team | "I'll send that doc" | — |
| Lisa Kestylboym | Update widget | "Lisa will update the widget" | — |
| (Self) | Circle back on timeline | "Let's circle back on this" | — |

Add these to Open Follow-Up Items? (y/all/select by number)
```

#### Step 4: Extract Decisions

Scan for decision patterns:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "We decided..." | "We decided to go with option A" |
| "The decision is..." | "The decision is to delay launch" |
| "We're going to..." | "We're going to use the new API" |
| "Approved:" | "Approved: new vendor contract" |
| "Agreement:" | "Agreement: weekly syncs instead of daily" |
| "Final call:" | "Final call: ship it Friday" |

Output format:
```
📌 DECISIONS FOUND: [count]

1. [Decision summary]
   → Quote: "[source text]"
   → Participants: [Names involved]
   → Log to: Decision_Log_[suggested topic].md?

2. [Decision summary]
   ...

Log these decisions? (y/all/select by number)
```

#### Step 5: Extract Hot Topics & Escalations

Scan for risk/escalation patterns:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "Blocked by..." | "We're blocked by the API team" |
| "Risk:" / "At risk:" | "This is at risk if we don't get resources" |
| "Escalate..." | "We need to escalate this to leadership" |
| "Concern:" | "My concern is the timeline" |
| "Issue:" | "The issue is budget approval" |

Output format:
```
🔥 POTENTIAL HOT TOPICS: [count]

| Topic | Type | Quote |
|-------|------|-------|
| API team blocker | Blocker | "We're blocked by the API team" |
| Timeline risk | Risk | "This is at risk if we don't..." |

Add to hot_topics.md? (y/n for each)
```

#### Step 6: Extract Key Topics & Context

Summarize main discussion points:
```
📝 MEETING SUMMARY

**Meeting**: [Type] with [Participants]
**Date**: [Today or specified date]

### Key Topics Discussed
1. [Topic 1] — [Brief summary]
2. [Topic 2] — [Brief summary]
3. [Topic 3] — [Brief summary]

### Notable Quotes
- "[Significant quote 1]" — [Speaker]
- "[Significant quote 2]" — [Speaker]

### Context for Future Reference
- [Any important background mentioned]
```

#### Step 7: Apply Extracted Items

After user confirmation:

1. **Follow-ups** → Add to today's daily report Open Follow-Up Items
2. **Decisions** → Create/append to appropriate Decision_Log_[Topic].md
3. **Hot topics** → Add to `private/tracking/hot_topics.md`
4. **New people** → Add to `private/context/people.md`
5. **Summary** → Add to daily report Notes & Capture Space

Final confirmation:
```
✅ TRANSCRIPT PROCESSED

Applied:
- ✓ [X] follow-ups added to daily report
- ✓ [Y] decisions logged to Decision_Log_[Topic].md
- ✓ [Z] hot topics added
- ✓ [N] new people added to people.md

Meeting summary added to today's Notes & Capture Space.
```
