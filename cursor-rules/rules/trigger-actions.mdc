## `/followup [person]: [topic]` — Track Action Items with Duplicate Detection

When the user types **`/followup [person]: [topic]`**, add a follow-up item to the daily report's Open Follow-Up Items table.

### Input Formats
| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Full format | `/followup [Name]: Review performance metrics` |
| Inline in notes | `Need to followup with [Name] on streaming timeline` |
| Quick tag | `/followup: Check with [Name] on AI adoption videos` |

### Duplicate Detection Behavior

**BEFORE adding any follow-up, check for potential duplicates:**

1. **Scan existing follow-ups** in today's daily report AND `private/tracking/open_followups.md` (if exists)
2. **Match on Person + Similar Topic**:
   - Same person name (case-insensitive, handle nicknames defined in people.md)
   - Topic similarity: >60% word overlap OR same key terms (e.g., "MCP", "streaming", "AI adoption")

3. **If potential duplicate found**, prompt:
   ```
   ⚠️ Possible duplicate detected:
   
   EXISTING: [Person] — [Existing topic] (added [Date])
   NEW:      [Person] — [New topic]
   
   Options:
   (a) Merge — Update existing with new context
   (b) Keep both — These are separate items
   (c) Replace — Delete old, add new
   (d) Skip — Don't add (already tracked)
   ```

4. **If user selects (a) Merge**:
   - Append new context to existing topic
   - Update date to today
   - Format: `[Original topic] → Updated: [new context]`
   - Example: `MCP performance metrics → Updated: also check latency benchmarks`

5. **If no duplicate**, add normally to Open Follow-Up Items table

### Follow-Up Entry Format
```markdown
| Person | Topic | Date Added | Status |
|--------|-------|------------|--------|
| [Name] | [Topic description] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | ⏳ Open |
```

### Person Matching Rules
Match input names to known people from `private/context/people.md`:
| Input | Matches To |
|-------|------------|
| [Nickname], [First], [Last] | [Full Name from people.md] |
| [Short name] | [Full Name] |
| (Self), Me, [Your first name] | (Self) |

*Configure your team's nicknames in people.md*

### Sorting Rules
When displayed in daily reports, follow-ups should be:
1. **Sorted alphabetically by Person**
2. **(Self) items always at the end**

### Status Values
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ⏳ Open | Not yet addressed |
| ✅ Done | Completed — remove at next /close |
| ➡️ Moved | Converted to priority or project |
| 🔄 Recurring | Ongoing check-in item |

### Marking Complete
To mark a follow-up complete:
- `/followup done: [person] [keyword]` — Marks matching item as ✅ Done
- During `/close` — Prompted to review open items

### Behavior Summary
1. Parse person and topic from input
2. Normalize person name against people.md
3. **Check for duplicates** (same person + similar topic)
4. If duplicate found → prompt for merge/keep/replace/skip
5. If merge selected → update existing entry with new context
6. If no duplicate → add new row to Open Follow-Up Items
7. Confirm: "Added follow-up: [Person] — [Topic]" or "Updated follow-up: [Person] — [Merged topic]"
