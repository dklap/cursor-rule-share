## 💡 Tips

- **Notes during the day**: Jot in the daily report's "Notes & Capture Space" — `/close` will process them
- **Quick decisions**: `/decision architecture: [one-liner]` — skips conversation flow
- **1:1 prep relevance**: Items near their accountability = top; org-wide FYI = "if time"
- **Variable 1:1s**: `/weekly` will ask about your manager's schedule
